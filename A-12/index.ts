//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
//print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
//with the person’s name.
let names: string[] = ["Irza","Faiza", "Sumaiya", "Laiba"];
console.log(`${names[0]} welcome to my home.`);
console.log(`${names[1]} welcome to my home.`);
console.log(`${names[2]} welcome to my home.`);
console.log(`${names[3]} welcome to my home.`);
